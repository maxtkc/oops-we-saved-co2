# TODO.md: Research Items for US Government Shutdown CO2 Savings

## Data Research Needed

### Critical Numbers (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **US Domestic Aviation Hourly CO2 Emissions**: Currently using ~28,542 tons/hour estimate
  - Source: Based on 250M tons annually ÷ 365 ÷ 24
  - Need actual BTS/FAA hourly flight data
  - Verify seasonal variations

- **Government Shutdown Flight Reduction Percentage**: Currently using 4%
  - Source: Historical analysis needed
  - Research actual flight data from previous shutdowns
  - Different shutdown lengths may have different impacts

- **Government Employee/Contractor Flight Volume**:
  - How many flights are government-related?
  - What percentage of total domestic flights?
  - Seasonal patterns in government travel

### EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalents (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Cars not driven for one year**: Currently using 0.00022 cars per ton CO2
  - Need official EPA calculation
  - Verify average car mileage and efficiency assumptions

- **Homes powered by solar for one month**: Currently using 0.11 homes per ton CO2
  - Need EPA solar energy calculations
  - Regional variations in solar effectiveness

- **Trees not needing to be planted**: Currently using 16.5 trees per ton CO2
  - Need official tree sequestration rates
  - Tree species and maturity considerations

- **Smartphones charged for one year**: Currently using 1,230 phones per ton CO2
  - Verify smartphone energy consumption
  - Update for newer phone models

- **Homes switching all bulbs to LED**: Currently using 1.8 homes per ton CO2
  - Need EPA LED conversion calculations
  - Average number of bulbs per household

### Historical Shutdown Data
- **Flight reduction data from specific shutdowns**:
  - 2018-2019 shutdown (35 days)
  - 2013 shutdown (16 days)
  - 1995-1996 shutdown (21 days)
- **Airport-specific impact data**
- **Regional variations in shutdown impact**

### Government Travel Patterns
- **Federal agency travel budgets**
- **Contractor business travel patterns**
- **Conference and meeting travel**
- **Essential vs non-essential travel classifications**

### Seasonal Variations
- **How flight patterns change by season**
- **Government travel seasonality**
- **Impact of shutdown timing (e.g., holiday season vs. summer)**

## Sources to Research

### Primary Government Sources

## Calculation Verification

### Current Assumptions to Verify
1. **Annual domestic aviation emissions**: 250 million tons CO2
2. **Hourly calculation**: 250M ÷ 365 ÷ 24 = 28,542 tons/hour
3. **Shutdown reduction**: 4% of total flights
4. **Savings rate**: 1,142 tons saved per hour

### Methodology Improvements
- Account for seasonal variations in flight volume
- Consider aircraft type differences in emissions
- Include radiative forcing factor for high-altitude emissions
- Regional differences in government travel patterns
